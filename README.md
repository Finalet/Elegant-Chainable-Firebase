# Elegant Chainable Firebase

Tired of manually typing your Firestore document paths, like `"users/${userID}/articles/${articleID}"`? Who even thought this would be a good idea? One typo and database no workie too much.

Behold: ‚ú® `elegant-chainable-firebase` ‚ú®. Define your Firebase schema and enjoy a fully safe, typed, and infinitely extendable access to your database.

## ü§î About

Elegant Chainable Firebase ü´¶ü•µüí¶ is a Firebase Admin SDK wrapper that removes the hasle of manually typing and keeping track of your Firestore collections and documents. Elegant Chainable Firebase provides a simple, chainable, fully typed API with convenient access to manipulate your data.

## üíª Installation

What do you expect from this section? If you use `npm`, run this line. Otherwise... idk, tough luck I guess.

```bash
npm i elegant-chainable-firebase
```

## üèÅ Quick Start

I know you can't handle reading this whole guide, so I pilled it all up into this one code block. So gracious.

```typescript
import { buildFirestoreSchema, initializeFirestore, DefineDocumentTypes } from "elegant-chainable-firebase/firestore";
import admin from "firebase-admin";

const app = admin.initializeApp(); // Your instance of the Firebase Admin SDK

const schema = buildFirestoreSchema({
  users: {
    doc: "user",
  },
} as const);

type DocumentDefinitions = DefineDocumentTypes<typeof schema, {
  user: User;
}>;

const firestore = initializeFirestore(app, schema, {} as DocumentDefinitions);
```

No idea how it works? Keep on readin', buddy.

## üëÄ Firestore Usage

### 1. Define schema

Firstly, you need to define a Firestore schema. This is the layout of your database and the only place where you should be manually writing collection names.

Imagine, you have the following Firestore setup:

```
users (collection)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {userID} (document)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks (sub-collection)
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {taskID} (document)
```

Use `buildFirestoreSchema` helper function to construct your schema with IntelliSense suggestions and TypeScript safety.

```typescript
import { buildFirestoreSchema } from "elegant-chainable-firebase/firestore";

const schema = buildFirestoreSchema({
  users: {          // collection name
    doc: "user",    // convenient name to access documents in this collection
    tasks: {
      doc: "task",
    },
  },
} as const);
```

Notice, how the collections are `users` and `tasks`, but we also set their keys `doc` to `user` and `task` respectively. Why? To make life harder developing this library, of course. Coincidentally, this creates a more intuitive interface to interact with Firestore.

Because of it, you are able to access your documents using singular language, which makes more sense:

```typescript
// Fetches document at `users/${userID}`
const user = await firestore.user(userID).fetch();

// Fetches document at `users/${userID}/tasks/${taskID}`
const task = await firestore.user(userID).task(taskID).fetch();
```

> **ü§§ Lessons learned:** Schema keys represent collection names, while their child key `doc` defines a convenient name to access documents in this collection.

### 2. Provide document types

Imagine fetching your data and getting fucking `DocumentSnapshot<DocumentData, DocumentData>` in return? Imagine that you also need to run `docSnapshot.data()` afterwards to get the actuall data? Literally psychotic.

If only you could get the document data with the exact TypeScript interface representation in just one call...

Define a new TypeScript type listing your documents with their corresponding interfaces. I even created a cute little helper type you can extend, `DefineDocumentTypes`, which will provide IntelliSense suggestions from your schema!

```typescript
import { DefineDocumentTypes } from "elegant-chainable-firebase/firestore";

const schema = buildFirestoreSchema(...)

type DocumentDefinitions = DefineDocumentTypes<typeof schema, {
  user: User,
  task: Task,
}>;
```

Now, simply pass an **empty object of this type** (deranged, I know) to `initializeFirestore` and the database will be fully aware of the objects within it!

```typescript
const firestore = initializeFirestore(app, schema, {} as DocumentDefinitions);

// Returns an object of type `User`
const user: User = firestore.user(userID).fetch();

// updateField() now only accepts available fields inside `Task`
const task: Task = firestore.user(userID).task(taskID).updateField("name");
```

Notice, that every key in `DocumentDefinitions` correspond to the names of each `doc` in the schema. This is important and makes sense.

> **ü§§ Lessons learned:** Google developers are mental, jump-scaring us with `DocumentSnapshot` when we just need the data. Use `DefineDocumentTypes` to safely declare types for your documents.

### 3. Initialize database

Finally, bazinga! Simply pass your schema and type definitions to `initializeFirestore` alongside your Firebase Admin SDK app instance: in the stuff goes, out the API comes.

```typescript
import { initializeFirestore, DefineDocumentTypes } from "elegant-chainable-firebase/firestore";
import admin from "firebase-admin";

const schema = buildFirestoreSchema(...)
type DocumentDefinitions = DefineDocumentTypes<typeof schema, ...>
const app = admin.initializeApp();

const firestore = initializeFirestore(app, schema, {} as DocumentDefinitions);
```

### 4. Use it

```typescript
// Fetch a properly typed user document
const user: User = await firestore.user(userID).fetch();

// Save a full user object
await firestore.user(userID).save(userData);

// Update only the user's name field to "Looser"
await firestore.user(userID).updateField("name", "Looser");

// Delete a user object
await firestore.user(userID).delete();

// Check if the user object exists
await firestore.user(userID).exists();
```

### 5. Extend functionality

Obviously, you are much cooler than me. So, you have methods that you need to perform safely on your data. Extend my `FirestoreDocument` class with your custom methods and include it in the schema as a `class` key.

```typescript
import { FirestoreDocument } from "elegant-chainable-firebase/firestore";

interface User {
  name: string;
  level: number;
  token: string;
}

class UserFirestoreDocument extends FirestoreDocument<User> {
  async levelUp(newLevel: number) {
    await this.updateField("level", newLevel);
  }

  async generateToken() {
    const token = MockCrypto.getToken();
    await this.updateField("token", token);
    return token;
  }
}

const schema = buildFirestoreSchema({
  users: {
    doc: "user",
    class: UserFirestoreDocument,
  },
} as const);
```

Now, your extended class will be used for the `user` documents. This is the recommended way of setting up Elegant Chainable Firebase. Having dedicated classes with custom methods manipulating data for each document is pretty cool.

```typescript
await firestore.user(userID).levelUp(420);
const token = await firestore.user(userID).generateToken();
```

> **ü§§ Lessons learned:** Please, please, please, extend functionality of `FirestoreDocument` to craft the perfect API for your own use case.
